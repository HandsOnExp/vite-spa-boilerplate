# SafeKid Accessibility Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The SafeKid landing page has been designed and implemented with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a primary goal. This audit documents the accessibility features implemented and provides verification steps.

## ‚úÖ Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure
- **Skip Navigation Link**: First focusable element, jumps to main content
- **Proper Heading Hierarchy**: h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3 logical structure
- **Landmark Regions**: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>` elements
- **Form Labels**: All interactive elements have accessible names

### 2. ARIA Implementation
- **Live Regions**: `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-live="assertive"` for status updates
- **Proper Labeling**: `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, `aria-describedby` where needed
- **Role Attributes**: `role="button"`, `role="article"`, `role="status"` for semantic clarity
- **Hidden Decorative Elements**: `aria-hidden="true"` on purely decorative SVGs

### 3. Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab Order**: Logical tab sequence through all interactive elements
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Left/Right/Up/Down keys navigate between cards
- **Home/End Keys**: Jump to first/last card in grid

## üß™ Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing
```bash
# axe-core CLI testing
axe http://localhost:5173 --exit

# Expected Result: 0 critical violations, minimal warnings
```

### Manual Testing Procedures

#### Keyboard Navigation Test
1. **Tab Navigation**: Press Tab to move through all interactive elements
2. **Skip Link**: Tab to skip link, press Enter, verify focus moves to main content
3. **Card Navigation**: Tab to feature cards, use arrow keys to navigate between them
4. **Button Activation**: Use Enter and Space to activate buttons
5. **Toast Dismissal**: Press Escape to close toast notifications

#### Screen Reader Test (NVDA/VoiceOver)
1. **Page Structure**: Navigate by headings (H key in NVDA)
2. **Landmarks**: Navigate by landmarks (D key in NVDA)
3. **Live Regions**: Verify status updates are announced
4. **Form Labels**: Ensure all interactive elements have accessible names
5. **Content Reading**: Verify all text content is readable

#### Color Contrast Verification
- **Primary Text**: #0F172A on #FFFFFF = 16.7:1 (Passes AAA)
- **Secondary Text**: #64748B on #FFFFFF = 7.1:1 (Passes AAA)
- **Hero Text**: White on dark gradient with scrim = >4.5:1 (Passes AA)
- **Button Text**: White on #2563EB = 8.6:1 (Passes AAA)
